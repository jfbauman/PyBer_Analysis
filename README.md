# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the new analysis is to show the relationstip between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders. We also found the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. This data can be used to improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results

The dataframe summary shows that in Urban cities, the average fare per ride is $24.53 compared to Rural cities where their average fare per ride is $34.62.
