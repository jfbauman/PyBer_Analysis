## Summary 
Based on the results, here are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- Increasing public transportation's areas of travel and efficiency can have a big impact on the community because it will reduce the likeliness of lateness of travelers to important things like work, meetings, doctors appointments, and getting home on time. 
- By keeping the prices down, the community can save money with using public transportation rather than the cost of owning their own vehicles, plus the additional costs that come along with owning a car like insurance and repairs. 
- Public transportation is a great option that immproves fuel efficiency and reduces air pollution.
